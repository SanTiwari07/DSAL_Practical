## DSAL Practicals

The `DSAL` directory contains laboratory practicals aligned with the DSAL syllabus.

- [Practical 1](./DSAL/Practical%201)
- [Practical 2](./DSAL/Practical%202)
- [Practical 3](./DSAL/Practical%203)
- [Practical 4](./DSAL/Practical%204)
- [Practical 5](./DSAL/Practical%205)
- [Practical 6](./DSAL/Practical%206)
- [Practical 7](./DSAL/Practical%207)

Each practical folder includes C++ source code implementing the required data structure or algorithm.
